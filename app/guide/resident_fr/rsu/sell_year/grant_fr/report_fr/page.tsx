            In your tax report, if you haven't already, please select form
            <span className="italic"> 2074</span>. The following calculator will
            help you determine how you should fill it out for RSU sales. For
            each sale, you will have to fill a new section of the form (fields
            512, 514, 515, 520, 521 and 524). Once you've filled out the form
            for all sale events, field 3VG should be pre-filled with your total
            adjusted gain / loss (in euros). That represents the
            <span className="italic"> Capital Gain</span> part of your tax
            report.
          </p>
          <p>
            To report the <span className="italic">Income</span> part, you will
            use field 1TZ ("gain imposable apr√®s abattement") and 1WZ
            ("abattement de 50%") of the main form.
